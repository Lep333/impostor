## How to play

1) Enter the player names. Then start the game.
   The players will receive a role according to the game.
   Either a player reads "impostor" or another word.
2) After everyone got their role, everyone says a word associated to the word given by the app.
   The impostor needs to try to say a word that others also associate with the given word.
3) Because the last part of the game is a voting. Where every player chooses who they think the imposor is.
   The impostor wins if they dont get the most votes (Or if they tie with other players with the most votes).
   Even if the impostor gets voted they still can win if they guess correctly the word!
